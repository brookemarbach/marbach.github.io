<p> My name is Brooke Marbach and I currently a sophomore at UW-Madison. I am majoring in <a href="https://humanecology.wisc.edu/academics/undergraduate-majors/consumer-behavior-marketplace-studies/">Consumer Behavior and Marketplace Studies</a>, as well as completing Digital Studies and Entrepreneurship certificates. Cooking and living a healthy lifestyle are passions of mine. I love to create healthy recipes and share them with friends and family. I created this virtual cookbook to share the healthy and easy to make recipes I have created with anyone and everyone. That being said, this virtual cookbook is the best place to find easy and healthy recipes. There are several breakfast, lunch and dinner recipes, as well as recipes that accomodate for dietary restrictions, such as vegetarianism and veganism. If you are a parent who needs quick and healthy recipes for your kids, a college student limited on time, but does not want to spend money eating out, vegan, vegetarian, you name it, this is the perfect place for you. </p>
